# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Crypto Risk-Return & Monte Carlo Simulation Analysis

*This project analyzes the risk-return characteristics of the top five cryptocurrenciesâ€”BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, and DOGEâ€”from 2024 to early 2025. Using historical data, key performance metrics such as annualized returns, volatility, and Sharpe Ratios were computed to evaluate each assetâ€™s risk-adjusted returns. A Risk vs Return scatter plot provides a visual comparison of how these cryptocurrencies balance risk and reward, while Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) quantify potential downside risks in extreme market conditions.*

*To forecast future price trends, a Monte Carlo Simulation with 10,000 possible price paths was implemented for each cryptocurrency. This simulation helps estimate potential future price movements, risks, and investment outcomes. Facet plots were used to compare different risk metrics and visualize expected price fluctuations over the next 252 trading days. Based on the findings, BTC appears to be the safest investment, SOL & DOGE offer high-risk/high-reward opportunities, while BNB shows a declining trend.*
